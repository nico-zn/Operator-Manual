Adding an aircraft to your fleet is very easy in OpenJet. Go to the Aircraft -> Aircraft List and click on the Add New button.

Complete the mandatory fields on the form:

- Tail Number.
- Flight Number (should you not use a specific Flight Number for the aircraft, input the tail number again).
- Aircraft Type (see below for aircraft types management).
- Back-office color. Avoid red as it could hide some errors or warnings on the flight list.
- Bases and Default base. You can enter multiple bases if you use multiple commercial bases for one aircraft. Default base is the main base of the aircraft.
- Select Available if you want your aircraft to be available for quoting.
- Select Available for auto-booking if you want your aircraft to be available for the optimization system.

Finally, click Save to validate your new aircraft. You have now access to all sections of your aircraft page.
