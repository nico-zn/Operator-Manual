User and roles

Each individual in your company can have private access to the platform. Each access is granted one ore more roles. 
The common roles are OPS, Sales, Pilot, Pilot Supervisor and Admin. 

We will set up your platform with these standard roles, but you can completely customize your roles (and their rights) to match your company’s way of working. 

For example, if you want your OPS agent’s to access the pricing area or the Sales Agent to access the flight schedule, it is possible.
