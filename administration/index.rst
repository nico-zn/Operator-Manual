Administration
==============

The administration of your OpenJet plateform is accessible with the "Admin" role. Of course, you may want some features normally accessible by **OPS** or **Sales** (e.g. Pricing, Aircraft Performances) to be accessible only by an administrator. This is possible by changing the rights associated to the roles. 

Contact support@openjet.com with your needs and we will do the necessary work.

This section will deal with the administration features that are commonly not accessible by **OPS** and **Sales**.
