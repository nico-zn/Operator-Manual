Customer Management
===================

OpenJet 360 provides you with a simple customer list using the menu **Customer > Customer list**. 

Customer are of two kinds: **Account** and **Contact**.

Customer and Passengers are the same in OpenJet, so each passenger you create will also be displayed in this list. To create a new customer or passenger, you can click on **Create New Account/Contact** or create directly in the reservation management page (see Manage reservations).

**Accounts** are for paying customers (whether Individual or Company) and have a full set of information.

**Contacts** are for passengers only with a simpler form.
